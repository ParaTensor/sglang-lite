# sglang-lite

**A minimal, production-grade LLM inference engine focused on MoE models.** High-cohesion "Token Factory" focused on:

- RadixAttention (prefix sharing for chat/agent workloads)
- Continuous batching scheduler
- Low-overhead decode with CUDA graph
- OpenAI-compatible API (the critical control point)

> "The engine is only responsible for reliably and efficiently producing tokens." — Push agent logic, structured output, and multimodal handling up to the gateway/harness layer (unigateway).

## Mission

A minimal, production-grade LLM inference engine focused exclusively on popular MoE models. It provides stable, high-throughput, low-latency token generation for MoE architectures. The core revolves around continuous batching + efficient KV cache (Radix) + expert-routing-aware execution, exposing a minimal and stable OpenAI-compatible interface.

It does **not** do: agent runtime, multimodal, built-in constrained decoding, speculative decoding, prefill-decode disaggregation, dynamic multi-LoRA, or complex expert parallelism scheduling.

## Why sglang-lite?

SGLang and vLLM are powerful, but their **accidental complexity** has become overwhelming. Many real production workloads (multi-turn chat, RAG, tool calling) do not need the full feature set, yet they pay the price in configuration hell, debugging difficulty, and instability caused by monthly changes.

sglang-lite follows a **high-cohesion + composable** design:
- The three core building blocks (RadixKVCache, BatchingScheduler, MoEModelRunner) are the only deeply coupled pieces.
- Each block is further decomposed internally (e.g. RadixTree + KVAllocator, BatchFormer, MoERouter + Executors).
- The Python engine core remains a small library, while this repository also ships an official thin standalone service.
- The sglang-lite engine process owns its orchestration loop, KV lifecycle, continuous batching, model execution, and token streaming.
- **UniGateway is optional**. It can sit above sglang-lite for multi-backend routing, auth, global admission, and policy, but sglang-lite does not require UniGateway, SGLang, or vLLM to serve requests.

A formal requirements document has been prepared for the UniGateway team:

**→ docs/unigateway-sglang-lite-requirements.md**

The goal is to achieve stable 80%+ of theoretical throughput in target scenarios (prefix-heavy chat/agent) with extremely low operational burden.

References: nano-vLLM (~1.2k LOC teaching version), mini-sglang.

**Scope note**: After re-evaluation, sglang-lite supports **only popular MoE models** (DeepSeek, Qwen-MoE, Mixtral-style, etc.). Dense models are explicitly out of scope. MoE routing and batching are first-class considerations, while keeping the overall design lightweight.

## vLLM Positioning Compatibility

sglang-lite is **not** a SGLang-only design and should not become a mini vLLM. It is a narrow MoE token factory that must remain compatible with vLLM at the **gateway/protocol/capability** layer:

- The three core capabilities are engine-neutral and apply equally to SGLang and vLLM: KV/prefix-cache management, continuous scheduling, and model execution. SGLang uses RadixAttention-oriented implementations; vLLM uses KVCacheManager/APC/PagedAttention, the V1 Scheduler, and GPUModelRunner/Worker.
- Capability equivalence is not product equivalence: FlashInfer supplies kernels, not vLLM's complete engine and serving ecosystem. `sglang-lite + FlashInfer` can be a targeted standalone vLLM alternative for the supported MoE/prefix-heavy envelope; UniGateway is an optional upstream gateway, not a runtime dependency.
- UniGateway should treat both sglang-lite and vLLM as `local-inference` backends.
- Shared compatibility target: OpenAI-compatible chat completions, streaming, models, health, request-id passthrough, and generic prefix-cache metrics such as `usage.cache_hit_tokens`.
- Internal concepts should map to generic names (`PrefixCache`, `BlockKVCache`, `ContinuousScheduler`, `ModelExecutor`) instead of leaking Radix/SGLang-specific terms into gateway core abstractions.
- vLLM-specific broad features (Responses API, multimodal, LoRA, spec decode, disaggregation, structured output backends) remain outside sglang-lite core.

See **docs/vllm-positioning-compatibility.md** for the detailed comparison and compatibility strategy.

## Target Workloads (Priority)

1. Multi-turn dialogue / Agent traffic (RadixAttention advantage is largest due to prefix sharing)
2. RAG + Tool Use (structured logic handled at gateway layer using outlines/xgrammar)
3. High-concurrency batch inference (evaluation, synthetic data generation)

## Non-Goals (Firmly out of scope for MVP)

- Multimodal (Vision/Audio/Video)
- Built-in Structured Output / JSON mode / Grammar (pushed to gateway)
- Speculative Decoding
- Prefill-Decode Disaggregation
- Dynamic Multi-LoRA
- Complex MoE expert parallelism scheduling and advanced load balancing (lite provides basic MoE routing + batching support)
- Diffusion / non-Transformer models
- Built-in SGLang-style frontend language

## Recommended Architecture — Independent Backend, Optional Gateway

The engine core is a pure MoE Token Factory library. The product also includes a thin Rust control/serving shell so users can run it directly.

**sglang-lite owns the complete local inference loop:**
- Engine loop, request/sequence lifecycle, KV allocation, continuous batching, model execution, sampling, and token deltas.
- Minimal OpenAI-compatible chat/stream/models/health/readiness/metrics surface.
- Backpressure, cancellation, timeout propagation, graceful drain, and engine error normalization required for safe standalone use.

```
Clients
  ↓ OpenAI
sglang-lite-serving (thin Rust control plane)
  ↓ internal HTTP/gRPC token stream
sglang-lite engine process
  • Engine loop
  • RadixKVCache + BatchingScheduler + MoEModelRunner
  • FlashInfer / Triton / CUDA kernels
```

For deployments that need a full gateway:

```
Clients → UniGateway → (sglang-lite | vLLM | SGLang)
```

UniGateway owns cross-backend routing, auth, rate limits, global policy, and aggregation. It communicates with sglang-lite over HTTP or gRPC and never drives the engine's internal building blocks in-process.

**Why this combination?**

- Thin Rust service layer: Type safety for the API surface, early rejection, and SSE lifecycle control.
- Python + Triton: Mature kernels and fast iteration for the core engine.
- Library-first core: the Python engine remains small and explicit; the official serving shell stays thin and contains no model execution or gateway business logic.

**Communication**: Use HTTP or gRPC for integration with unigateway. Direct embedding (e.g. PyO3) is not used to keep unigateway as a general SDK.

## Tech Stack

- **Rust API**: axum, tokio, serde, serde_json, tracing, reqwest (to Python), uuid
- **Python Core**: torch, transformers (for initial loading/tokenizer), triton (kernels), flashinfer (optional)
- **Interface**: Minimal OpenAI-compatible + clean internal request/response
- **Deployment**: Single-node + simple tensor parallelism. Complex distributed serving later.

## MVP Roadmap (Phases)

**Phase 0 (Core Verification)**

- Rust: Full /v1/chat/completions (stream + non-stream) + /v1/models + /healthz
- Define internal GenerationRequest / Token protocol
- Python side: Working MoE-aware engine with basic routing + batching (switchable to real HF MoE models)
- Able to run popular MoE models (e.g. Mixtral, DeepSeek, Qwen-MoE class)
- Basic continuous batching + simple Radix skeleton (even if imperfect at first)
- Metrics: tokens/s, TTFT, cache hit (even if mocked)

**Phase 1 (Production Ready)**

- Real Radix KV Cache + deep Scheduler integration
- CUDA graph decode path
- Prometheus metrics, structured logging, graceful shutdown, request timeouts
- Mainstream MoE model support (validate throughput at 70B+ scale)
- Configuration presets ("lite" defaults)

**Phase 2**

- Optional Paged strategy
- Limited model extension points
- Optionally migrate scheduler/KV hotspots to Rust
- Deep integration validation with unigateway (KV affinity, etc.)

## Quick Start (current stub state)

```bash
# Rust serving wrapper (thin standalone)
cargo run -p sglang-lite-serving

# or Python stub
python -m sglang_lite.server
```

Then:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat",
    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],
    "max_tokens": 128,
    "stream": true
  }'
```

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).
The concrete work required to reach a standalone production service is tracked in
[docs/standalone-inference-service-roadmap.md](docs/standalone-inference-service-roadmap.md).

## Contribution and Scope Discipline

Please strictly follow the scope. Before adding any new feature, ask: Does it belong to the high-cohesion "Token Factory" core? If it is business logic, please push it upward.

## License

Apache-2.0 (to be confirmed)

## Status

Phase 1 in progress (MoE-focused production shell + metrics + robustness).
See v0.1.0 for the last Phase 0 release (pre-MoE scope realignment). Not for production use yet.

See git history and docs for detailed design discussions.

## Optional Integration with UniGateway

sglang-lite can be used directly or as a backend of [unigateway](https://github.com/EeroEternal/unigateway).

### Running for UniGateway (HTTP mode)

sglang-lite can be run as a standalone OpenAI-compatible server that unigateway can connect to.

Example:

```bash
# Using the example server
python -m sglang_lite.server \
  --port 8000 \
  --model "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat" \
  --device cuda \
  --max-batch-size 8
```

Or use the Rust binary which proxies to a Python core:

```bash
SGLANG_LITE_PYTHON_CORE=http://localhost:9001 PORT=8000 ./target/debug/sglang-lite-serving
```

### Environment variables (for Config.from_env)

- SGLANG_LITE_MODEL
- SGLANG_LITE_DEVICE
- SGLANG_LITE_PORT
- SGLANG_LITE_MAX_BATCH_SIZE
- SGLANG_LITE_MAX_CONCURRENT
- SGLANG_LITE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT
- SGLANG_LITE_LOG_LEVEL

### UniGateway TOML example

```toml
[[providers]]
name = "my-moe"
provider_type = "sglang-lite"
base_url = "http://localhost:8000/v1"
# api_key can be empty for local
api_key = ""

[providers.model_policy]
default_model = "local-moe"
```

See unigateway docs for full details.

### Response format for cache metrics passthrough

The usage object in responses includes:

```json
"usage": {
  "prompt_tokens": 20,
  "completion_tokens": 10,
  "total_tokens": 30,
  "cache_hit_tokens": 12
}
```

This allows unigateway to extract cache hit information.
