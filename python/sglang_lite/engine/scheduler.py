"""
Realistic continuous batching scheduler for sglang-lite Phase 0.

Responsibilities:
- Accept new requests and immediately try Radix prefix match.
- Maintain waiting queue and running set.
- In each `step()` decide which sequences need prefill vs decode.
- Return a batch that the ModelRunner can execute together.
- Track per-sequence cached_len so the runner knows what is new.
