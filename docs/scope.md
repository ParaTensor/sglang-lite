# sglang-lite Scope & Feature Classification

This is the authoritative reference for what belongs in core vs. what gets pushed out.

## One-sentence Mission

> An extremely cohesive production token generator primarily for MoE models. Everything not required to reliably turn requests into token streams at high throughput stays outside.

The engine focuses exclusively on popular MoE architectures (Mixtral-style, DeepSeek-style, Qwen-MoE, etc.). Dense models are out of scope. MoE support is first-class.

**MoE families** (see `engine/models.py`): Mixtral-style, Qwen-MoE, DeepSeek-MoE. Only the model
successfully loaded in the current process is advertised on `GET /v1/models`. Local CI uses
`fixture:<path>` tiny Mixtral weights. Dense models are rejected.

**Execution status**: prefix reuse stores paged K/V + `last_logits`; the runner rebuilds HF
attention state from pages before forward (pages are required, not optional mirrors).
Scheduler groups requests; the runner issues **tensor-batched** HF forwards when sequences share
the same `cached_len` (and prefill new-length). FlashInfer paged-append is used when available
on CUDA; full FlashInfer attention/MoE kernels remain P1.

The `engine/` core is a **pure library** exposing three further-decomposed building blocks (RadixKVCache, BatchingScheduler, MoEModelRunner). The sglang-lite product also ships a thin standalone control/serving shell so it can serve users without SGLang, vLLM, or UniGateway.

**Ownership boundary**:
- The sglang-lite engine process owns the central engine loop, waiting/running sequence lifecycle, token-budget scheduling, KV lifecycle, model execution, sampling, cancellation cleanup, and token deltas.
- The thin Rust control/serving shell owns the minimal OpenAI-compatible chat/stream/models/health/readiness surface and the request lifecycle needed for safe standalone operation.
- UniGateway is optional and owns only advanced gateway concerns: multi-backend routing, auth, global rate limiting, tenant policy, and aggregation.

**Critical boundary**: External hosts such as UniGateway communicate with sglang-lite over HTTP or gRPC only. PyO3 or direct in-process embedding is not used.

**vLLM compatibility boundary**: KV cache management/prefix reuse, continuous scheduling, and model execution are shared engine capabilities in both SGLang and vLLM; RadixKVCache, BatchingScheduler, and MoEModelRunner are sglang-lite's implementations of them. sglang-lite must be compatible with vLLM as a peer `local-inference` backend at the protocol/capability/metrics layer, but it does not inherit vLLM's broad model/API/feature scope. External abstractions should use generic names (`PrefixCache`, `BlockKVCache`, `ContinuousScheduler`, `ModelExecutor`, `BackendCapabilities`) rather than Radix- or SGLang-only concepts.

**Replacement boundary**: FlashInfer is a kernel/backend dependency, not a complete inference engine. A completed standalone sglang-lite plus FlashInfer may replace vLLM for supported MoE, prefix-heavy deployments; UniGateway is optional. This does not expand scope to vLLM's full model, hardware, distributed, quantization, multimodal, LoRA, or advanced decoding matrix.

## Classification Rules

- **重构 / Must Control** — Re-implement or own the logic. This is where complexity lives and where we gain long-term maintainability + differentiation.
- **Hybrid (过渡)** — Reuse proven pieces (loaders, specific kernel wrappers) but wrap and gradually own the path.
- **直接引用** — Safe to import directly (tokenizer, HF config registry, stable model definitions).
- **不做 (MVP)** — Explicitly out of scope. Implementations that try to add them will be rejected.

## Summary Counts (MVP)

- **重构** (own completely): 12+
- **Hybrid** (reuse pieces, own path): 4
- **直接引用** (infrastructure): ~4 (tokenizers, HF loaders, basic quant loaders, kernel functions)
- **明确不做**: 6+

MoE support is first-class. The three core pieces are decomposed internally, but their hot-path composition and engine loop remain owned by sglang-lite.

The core stays an ultra-minimal library. The repository's thin standalone layer owns only the serving, configuration, observability, and admission required for one local engine; advanced gateway concerns stay outside.

## What "Lite" Means in Practice (MoE-only)

- Very small number of startup flags (sensible presets).
- Predictable behavior under load.
- Easy to reason about one request's journey through the system.
- The three building blocks are internally decomposed for modularity. sglang-lite owns the engine loop; an external gateway may supply only high-level policy hints through stable protocols.
- Dense models are explicitly out of scope.
- vLLM is a peer backend to interoperate with through UniGateway, not a feature checklist to copy.
- Minimal standalone serving and engine-local ops live in dedicated thin layers. Cross-backend and business concerns stay in UniGateway or another gateway.
- Codebase should stay small enough that a single engineer can hold the mental model.

## Enforcement

Any PR that adds a feature from the "不做" column or significantly increases coupling across the API/KV/Scheduler boundary without strong justification will be closed with reference to this document.
