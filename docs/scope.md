# sglang-lite Scope & Feature Classification

This is the authoritative reference for what belongs in core vs. what gets pushed out.

## One-sentence Mission

> **DeepSeek-V4-Flash 专用**、极致高内聚的 Token Factory。性能（相对同配置 SGLang）优先于通用性；一切与 V4-Flash 热路径无关的模型面与协议面默认不做。

**权威专用路线**：[v4-flash-only.md](./v4-flash-only.md)（2026-08-08 采纳）。

**唯一一等公民模型**：DeepSeek-V4-Flash（含 0731 权重形态）。  
其它 MoE（Mixtral / Qwen-MoE / MiniMax 等）与 Qwen thruput/FORCE_HF 栈降为 **legacy**（可删、不进默认门禁、不占用 P0）。  
Dense 端侧模型 **不在本产品线**。

执行原则：

1. **焊死 V4-Flash**：load 拒绝非 V4 配置；热路径只有 `v4_runner`（目标态）。  
2. **搬代码不引大包**：从 vLLM / SGLang / 官方 `inference/` **vendor 进仓**（改 import），禁止 runtime `import sglang` / `import vllm`。  
3. **KPI**：同机同权重 vs SGLang 的 warm decode tok/s（及约定 TTFT），见 v4-flash-only §5。  
4. 调度 + Radix 双池仍自持；OpenAI 面仍在 Rust `control/`，业务上移 UniGateway。

**Execution status**（V4 专用后）:

| 路径 | 当前阶段 | KV / prefix | Decode 内核 | 备注 |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **DeepSeek-V4-Flash** | Hybrid 已落地；转向 **专用 runner + vendor 核** | dual-pool；Owned 页为源 | 官方 sparse / vendor SGLang·vLLM 子集；满图 | **唯一 P0** |
| legacy 多 MoE | 冻结 | 历史 Radix paged | HF/FI | 不优化、不门禁 |

The `engine/` core is a **pure library** exposing three further-decomposed building blocks (RadixKVCache, BatchingScheduler, MoEModelRunner). The sglang-lite product also ships a thin standalone control/serving shell so it can serve users without SGLang, vLLM, or UniGateway.

**Ownership boundary**:
- The sglang-lite engine process owns the central engine loop, waiting/running sequence lifecycle, token-budget scheduling, KV lifecycle, model execution, sampling, cancellation cleanup, and token deltas.
- The thin Rust control/serving shell owns the minimal OpenAI-compatible chat/stream/models/health/readiness surface and the request lifecycle needed for safe standalone operation.
- UniGateway is optional and owns only advanced gateway concerns: multi-backend routing, auth, global rate limiting, tenant policy, and aggregation.

**Critical boundary**: External hosts such as UniGateway communicate with sglang-lite over HTTP or gRPC only. PyO3 or direct in-process embedding is not used.

**vLLM compatibility boundary**: KV cache management/prefix reuse, continuous scheduling, and model execution are shared engine capabilities in both SGLang and vLLM; RadixKVCache, BatchingScheduler, and MoEModelRunner are sglang-lite's implementations of them. sglang-lite must be compatible with vLLM as a peer `local-inference` backend at the protocol/capability/metrics layer, but it does not inherit vLLM's broad model/API/feature scope. External abstractions should use generic names (`PrefixCache`, `BlockKVCache`, `ContinuousScheduler`, `ModelExecutor`, `BackendCapabilities`) rather than Radix- or SGLang-only concepts.

**Replacement boundary**: FlashInfer is a kernel/backend dependency, not a complete inference engine. A completed standalone sglang-lite plus FlashInfer may replace vLLM for supported MoE, prefix-heavy deployments; UniGateway is optional. This does not expand scope to vLLM's full model, hardware, distributed, quantization, multimodal, LoRA, or advanced decoding matrix.

## Classification Rules

- **重构 / Must Control** — Re-implement or own the logic. This is where complexity lives and where we gain long-term maintainability + differentiation.
- **Hybrid (过渡)** — Reuse proven pieces (loaders, specific kernel wrappers) but wrap and gradually own the path.
- **直接引用** — Safe to import directly (tokenizer, HF config registry, stable model definitions).
- **不做 (MVP)** — Explicitly out of scope. Implementations that try to add them will be rejected.

## Summary Counts (MVP)

- **重构** (own completely): 12+
- **Hybrid** (reuse pieces, own path): 4
- **直接引用** (infrastructure): ~4 (tokenizers, HF loaders, basic quant loaders, kernel functions)
- **明确不做**: 6+

MoE support is first-class. The three core pieces are decomposed internally, but their hot-path composition and engine loop remain owned by sglang-lite.

The core stays an ultra-minimal library. The repository's thin standalone layer owns only the serving, configuration, observability, and admission required for one local engine; advanced gateway concerns stay outside.

## What "Lite" Means in Practice (MoE-only)

- Very small number of startup flags (sensible presets).
- Predictable behavior under load.
- Easy to reason about one request's journey through the system.
- The three building blocks are internally decomposed for modularity. sglang-lite owns the engine loop; an external gateway may supply only high-level policy hints through stable protocols.
- Dense models are explicitly out of scope.
- vLLM is a peer backend to interoperate with through UniGateway, not a feature checklist to copy.
- Minimal standalone serving and engine-local ops live in dedicated thin layers. Cross-backend and business concerns stay in UniGateway or another gateway.
- Codebase should stay small enough that a single engineer can hold the mental model.

## Enforcement

Any PR that adds a feature from the "不做" column or significantly increases coupling across the API/KV/Scheduler boundary without strong justification will be closed with reference to this document.
