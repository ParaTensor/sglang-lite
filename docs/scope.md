# sglang-lite Scope & Feature Classification

This is the authoritative reference for what belongs in core vs. what gets pushed out.

## One-sentence Mission

> An extremely cohesive production token generator primarily for MoE models. Everything not required to reliably turn requests into token streams at high throughput stays outside.

The engine focuses exclusively on popular MoE architectures (Mixtral-style, DeepSeek-style, Qwen-MoE, etc.). Dense models are out of scope. MoE support is first-class.

**unigateway is the backend driver** (driver code lives in the unigateway repo):
- It loads and drives the sglang-lite engine (preferred: direct Python library import from unigateway).
- All serving (HTTP/gRPC), routing, auth, rate-limit, advanced config, observability export, graceful shutdown, admission control, and timeouts live in unigateway.
- Any backend registration, connection management, or driver glue moves to unigateway.
- sglang-lite remains a minimal pure library (only the three high-cohesion pieces).

## Classification Rules

- **重构 / Must Control** — Re-implement or own the logic. This is where complexity lives and where we gain long-term maintainability + differentiation.
- **Hybrid (过渡)** — Reuse proven pieces (loaders, specific kernel wrappers) but wrap and gradually own the path.
- **直接引用** — Safe to import directly (tokenizer, HF config registry, stable model definitions).
- **不做 (MVP)** — Explicitly out of scope. Implementations that try to add them will be rejected.

## Summary Counts (MVP)

- **重构** (own completely): 12+
- **Hybrid** (reuse pieces, own path): 4
- **直接引用** (infrastructure): ~4 (tokenizers, HF loaders, basic quant loaders, kernel functions)
- **明确不做**: 6+

MoE support is now first-class. The "lite" philosophy remains: keep the core (KV + Scheduler + Runner) highly cohesive and as simple as possible while making popular MoE models work well with Radix prefix sharing and continuous batching.

Serving (HTTP server), config management, advanced observability, auth/rate-limit, and routing are explicitly peeled to unigateway or thin dedicated projects. sglang-lite is a pure engine library.

## What "Lite" Means in Practice (MoE-only)

- Very small number of startup flags (sensible presets).
- Predictable behavior under load.
- Easy to reason about one request's journey through the system.
- MoE routing is handled cleanly in the runner. Scheduler and KV Cache stay focused on throughput and prefix sharing rather than full expert scheduling complexity.
- Dense models are explicitly out of scope (no compatibility).
- Serving, ops, and cross-cutting concerns are peeled to unigateway or dedicated thin layers. The core is a pure library.
- Codebase should stay small enough that a single engineer can hold the mental model.

## Enforcement

Any PR that adds a feature from the "不做" column or significantly increases coupling across the API/KV/Scheduler boundary without strong justification will be closed with reference to this document.
