# sglang-lite Scope & Feature Classification

This is the authoritative reference for what belongs in core vs. what gets pushed out.

## One-sentence Mission

> An extremely cohesive production token generator primarily for MoE models. Everything not required to reliably turn requests into token streams at high throughput stays outside.

The engine focuses exclusively on popular MoE architectures (Mixtral-style, DeepSeek-style, Qwen-MoE, etc.). Dense models are out of scope. MoE support is first-class.

sglang-lite is a **pure library** exposing three further-decomposed building blocks (RadixKVCache, BatchingScheduler, MoEModelRunner). The orchestrator and most policy logic live in the driver.

**unigateway as backend driver** (driver code lives in the unigateway repository):
- Uses the three building blocks directly (unigateway owns the main loop and admission control).
- Handles all serving, routing, auth, rate-limit, advanced config, metrics export, graceful shutdown, etc.
- sglang-lite only owns the high-cohesion core pieces (internal decomposition is allowed for modularity).

**Critical boundary**: Communication with sglang-lite must use HTTP or gRPC only. PyO3 or direct in-process embedding is not used, to preserve unigateway as a general SDK.

## Classification Rules

- **重构 / Must Control** — Re-implement or own the logic. This is where complexity lives and where we gain long-term maintainability + differentiation.
- **Hybrid (过渡)** — Reuse proven pieces (loaders, specific kernel wrappers) but wrap and gradually own the path.
- **直接引用** — Safe to import directly (tokenizer, HF config registry, stable model definitions).
- **不做 (MVP)** — Explicitly out of scope. Implementations that try to add them will be rejected.

## Summary Counts (MVP)

- **重构** (own completely): 12+
- **Hybrid** (reuse pieces, own path): 4
- **直接引用** (infrastructure): ~4 (tokenizers, HF loaders, basic quant loaders, kernel functions)
- **明确不做**: 6+

MoE support is first-class. The three core pieces are now further decomposed internally (RadixKVCache, BatchingScheduler, MoEModelRunner) so that unigateway (as driver) can own composition and policy.

sglang-lite is an ultra-minimal pure library. Serving, config, observability, admission, etc. are peeled to unigateway.

## What "Lite" Means in Practice (MoE-only)

- Very small number of startup flags (sensible presets).
- Predictable behavior under load.
- Easy to reason about one request's journey through the system.
- The three building blocks are internally decomposed for modularity. unigateway (the driver) owns the main loop and higher-level policies.
- Dense models are explicitly out of scope.
- Serving, ops, and cross-cutting concerns are peeled to unigateway or dedicated thin layers. The core is a pure library.
- Codebase should stay small enough that a single engineer can hold the mental model.

## Enforcement

Any PR that adds a feature from the "不做" column or significantly increases coupling across the API/KV/Scheduler boundary without strong justification will be closed with reference to this document.
